# Python Bridge Tools

This repository holds tools I am creating to help me check bridge structural plans and details.

## Bridge Grades

The bridge grades tool helps calculate grades along a roadway alignment. It currently accounts for horizontal alignments, vertical alignments, and superelevation transition calculations along the profile grade line. The plan is to add bridge elements to the alignment, so calculations can be made at various locations along a bridge to help establish pier geometry and aid it vertical clearance calculations.

## Future Tools I Would Like to Add

    1. Plate girder properties
    2. Rolled steel shapes library
    3. AASHTO LRFD steel and concrete design calculations
    4. USGS Design Ground Motions
